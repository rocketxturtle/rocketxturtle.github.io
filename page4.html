						<p style="color:black"> Astronomy on Tap is a global organization started by astronomers in NYC to foster public awarness of astrophysical research, primarily through bars. The Salt Lake City chapter was started in 2022, and I took over as the organizer and host in 2023. In the past three years, I have over doubled the number of attendees (our record event attendance is ~150 people!!) per event, and have in total reached hundreds of people. Through my work on AoT, I have also developed strong connections between the astronomy community, local businesses, and the general public in SLC. I also worked closely with graduate students in other departments to advise on the creation of a more general Science on Tap, which has proven similarly successful. </p>

						<p style="color:black"> Astrobites is a graduate-student run organization which writes daily summaries of published astronomy and astrophysical articles. I have been an author for Astrobites since January 2024, and have written over a dozen articles. These range from summaries of recent galactic archeology papers, to guides on navigating academia, to interviews with notable figures in astronomy. I also served as the Astrobites Media Intern during the 247th meeting of the American Astronomical Society, during which I was responsible for live-blogging the events, interviewing plenary speakers and running press conferences. A selection of my most recent articles can be found below! </p>
