                        <p style="color:black">I was born in India, and moved to Texas when I was three; as a result, I have a lot of practice making unusally spicy barbeque (one day I'll make a software with the backronym BRISKET...). After growing up near Dallas, I attended undergrad at the University of Texas at Austin, where I was a researcher in both the Nuclear Archeometry Lab under Dr. Sheldon Landsberger, as well as the Galactic Archeology group with Dr. Keith Hawkins. In 2021, I earned my B.S. in Physics and B.S. in Astronomy. I then moved to Salt Lake City, Utah to begin grad school at the University of Utah. And I haven't gotten my degree yet, so I'm stickin' around here for another bit longer! </p>

							<center><h1 style="color:orange"><u>A bit about me</u><br />
                        </header>

						<p style="color:black"> Whenever I'm not doing research I'm usually disappearing somewhere into the woods or desert to go camping, backpacking, rafting, etc... with my girlfriend Sam and dog Kuiper (pictured below). My biggest not-like-other-girls trait in Utah is that I'm not a skiier or climber, instead I prefer doing weightlifting and I dabbled in longsword fighting for a bit. Outside of physical hobbies, I usually end up at home making various salsas, watching old movies (just watched The Mummy!), or writing historical fiction. </p>
